# **ReadME Generator Project**

  ## **Description**

 I was tasked by the client to create a README generator to save time when doing project work. This will enable me to speedily develop a README and put more time into the development lifecycle. 

```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

The README generator taking in user input from an NPM called Inquirier. It will ask the user for the following:

- The Project Name
- The Project Description

1. Installation
2. Usage
3. Contributions
4. Tests Run
5. Questions
6. License Details

After the information has been collected, it is parsed into a data object which is then used to populate the values within the markdown text. 

## Challenges Faced

### Dealing with Markdown rather than HTML

At first I found it quite confusing working with Markdown syntax, rather than HTML. Although Markdown seems easier, it was strange using backticks with Markdown rather than HTML.

### Pulling the GitHub Bages

I had trouble thinking of how to pull down the badge license info. Do I populate an array and add some logic to determine whichever is picked, display the correct badge? I eventually found a website called [ShieldsIO] (https://shields.io/category/license) which helped.


## Installation

The application can be run by invoking the following command on the index.js file:

```
node index.js
```


The README generated by the script is called "SampleREADME.md".
